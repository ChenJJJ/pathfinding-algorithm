## About ##

You have reached Daniel Harabor's Code Repository. If you would like to know about me or my work (or are simply looking for copies of published papers) please visit my [homepage](http://harabor.net/daniel).

Some things that are hosted in this repository:

* Implementations of Jump Point Search and JPS+.
* An implementation of the Anya and Polyanya search algorithms (the latter is a 2017-10-17 snapshot taken from Michael Cui's [repository](https://bitbucket.org/mlcui1/polyanya))
* Other algorithms (often search algorithms) that I have found useful or interesting.

My development platform is OSX 10.8.4 with most of the code here being written in C++. When compiling I recommend that platform together with GCC 4.8.1. In the past I have successfully compiled and executed the same code on Linux (most recently Ubuntu 13.10). 

The current "release" is tagged [may2016](https://bitbucket.org/dharabor/pathfinding/commits/tag/may2016).

All code is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL Version 2. I make it available in the interest of scientific research and without any guarantees.
